 *** Warnings during configuration ***

* Cross-compilation detected, so exception handling cannot be tested.
  Note that broken exception handling in your compiler may lead to unexpected
  crashes.

* configure cannot check whether malloc() and realloc() are GNU libc
  compatible. You have to be ABSOLUTELY sure that they are, otherwise run
  configure with the --without-gnu-malloc switch.
